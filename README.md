# Room Checker, on Streamlit
Checks what rooms are free at a particular time. Currently implemented only for midsems.

Built this in an hour using ChatGPT and Streamlit. The whole point is to just have something up and running for me and my friends to use outside when looking for rooms to study in during midsems.
